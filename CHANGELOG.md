# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While the project is pre-1.0 (`0.x.y`), the `0.y` segment serves as the major
version: breaking changes bump `y`, additive changes bump `z`. See
[`docs/PIPELINE_MATURITY.md`](docs/PIPELINE_MATURITY.md) for per-pipeline
stability guarantees.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-13

Adds `LipDubPipeline` from upstream PR #212 as a new
**[experimental tier](docs/PIPELINE_MATURITY.md) pipeline**.

### Added

- **`LipDubPipeline`** + `lipdub` CLI subcommand. Two-stage lip-dubbing
  pipeline that takes a reference video providing both visual structure
  (via IC-LoRA reference latent appends) and target audio (via the audio
  VAE encoded as `AudioConditionByReferenceLatent`). Frame count is
  auto-derived from the reference video metadata (snapped to `8k+1`).
  Stage 2 keeps the stage-1 audio latent unchanged (`frozen=True`
  semantics) and only refines the video. Exported from
  `ltx_pipelines_mlx` as `LipDubPipeline`.

  **Known limitations** (model-level, not a port bug):
  - Output audio is a **VAE+vocoder reconstruction** of the reference
    audio, perceptually similar but not bit-identical to the input.
    Spectral artifacts can be audible on rich musical content. To
    preserve the original audio bit-exact, remux the source audio over
    the output mp4 via ffmpeg post-pipeline (loses fine lip-sync but
    preserves source music).
  - Lip-sync quality depends on prompt-audio alignment. Generic prompts
    produce visually plausible but loosely-synced output.
  - Uses `Lightricks/LTX-2.3-22b-IC-LoRA-LipDub` (currently `v0.9`).
    Pin a specific app version if depending on the current behaviour.

  Classified as **Experimental** in `docs/PIPELINE_MATURITY.md`. The
  CLI `--help` output marks it as `[experimental]`.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-13

Upstream sync from Lightricks/LTX-2 PR #212 — surfaces two **default value
changes**. No public API additions or removals; existing callers that pass
explicit values are unaffected, but consumers that relied on the previous
defaults should retest before upgrading.

### Changed (potentially breaking for callers relying on defaults)

- **`TilingConfig.default()`** spatial config bumped from `512×512` /
  `64` overlap to **`768×768` / `64` overlap**; temporal config from
  `64` frames / `24` overlap to **`80` frames / `24` overlap**. Matches
  upstream's tradeoff (fewer tile boundaries at production resolutions).
  Our internal pipelines do not call `TilingConfig.default()` directly,
  but external consumers using this helper will get the new defaults.
- **`precompute_rope_freqs` default `rope_type`** switched from
  `"interleaved"` to `"split"`. All in-repo call sites pass `rope_type=`
  explicitly so this is a no-op for our pipelines, but external consumers
  that called `precompute_rope_freqs` without specifying `rope_type` will
  see different output (the LTX-2.3 checkpoints all use SPLIT — upstream
  switched the default to match reality).

### Added

- `AudioConditionByReferenceLatent` now exported from
  `ltx_core_mlx.conditioning` and `ltx_core_mlx.conditioning.types`
  (was previously importable only from the leaf module).

## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-13

Additive upstream sync from Lightricks/LTX-2 PR #212 (merged upstream 2026-05-11),
plus a low-risk internal refactor. No public default values change in this
release.

### Added

- `iclora_utils.py` module exposing the shared IC-LoRA helpers from upstream
  PR #212: `read_lora_reference_downscale_factor`,
  `downsample_mask_video_to_latent`, `append_ic_lora_reference_video_conditionings`.
  Used by ic-lora and the upcoming lip-dub pipeline.
- `AudioConditionByReferenceLatent` conditioning type for appending
  reference audio tokens with negative-shifted RoPE positions. Audio-side
  mirror of `VideoConditionByReferenceLatent`.
- `ltx_core_mlx.components.diffusion_steps` — `EulerDiffusionStep`,
  `Res2sDiffusionStep`, `EulerCfgPpDiffusionStep` primitives + protocol +
  `_get_ancestral_step` helper. Available as standalone primitives;
  existing samplers still inline this math (no behaviour change for
  current pipelines).
- `ltx_core_mlx.utils.diffusion` — `to_velocity` / `to_denoised` helpers
  matching upstream.

### Changed

- `ic_lora.py` refactored to delegate the IC-LoRA reference video
  conditioning to `iclora_utils.append_ic_lora_reference_video_conditionings`.
  -151 LOC net. Public API unchanged. Bit-exact regression validated
  against the pre-refactor Q20 baseline (SHA256 match).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `--start-strength` / `--end-strength` flags on `keyframe` CLI to expose
  per-keyframe conditioning strength (upstream-iso surface, default `1.0`).
- Static-scene I2V recipe documentation (ic-lora + canny control video),
  validated end-to-end on Phoenix Q15.
- Standalone `upscale` pipeline + CLI subcommand (VAE encode → neural
  upsampler → VAE decode, no DiT).
- Modality tiling (`--tile-frames N --tile-spatial M`) on `generate` (one-stage /
  --two-stage / --two-stages-hq), `a2v`, `keyframe`.

### Fixed
- `ic_lora` upstream-iso tightening: fix `UnboundLocalError` introduced by an
  earlier edit, 4 API alignments with upstream `ICLoraPipeline._create_conditionings`.
- Default `stg_scale=1.0` restored on standard pipelines (matches upstream
  `LTX_2_3_PARAMS`). Was hardcoded `0.0` for 32 GB Mac compat — that's now
  the user's choice, not the default.
- Strip appended keyframe tokens before unpatchify across all pipelines (fix
  for multi-anchor I2V at `frame_idx > 0`).
- Multi-image conditioning propagated to all I2V pipelines; upstream-iso
  `combined_image_conditionings` helper used end-to-end.
- Metal watchdog: drop wasteful Gemma re-load in `load()` methods (Gemma was
  being loaded twice — once before forward, once before DiT — causing 7.5 GB
  heap thrash). Production-quality generation on M2 Pro 32 GB now passes
  under sustained system contention.

### Changed
- `media_io.py` ported 1:1 upstream-iso (replaces the previous divergent
  shim).
- `prepare_image_for_encoding` applies H.264 CRF round-trip (matches
  upstream's training-distribution pre-processing).
- `metal_watchdog.py` removed; auto eval gating (per-layer Gemma /
  per-block connector) supersedes the opt-in `LTX2_METAL_WATCHDOG_GUARD` env var.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-08

### Removed (BREAKING)
- `ImageToVideoPipeline` removed — no upstream equivalent. I2V is now
  supported on every public pipeline via `image=` kwarg / `--image` CLI flag
  (consistent with upstream's `combined_image_conditionings` pattern).

## [0.9.x] - 2026-05 (pre-isomorphism patch series)

Series of bit-exact iso-tightening patches across pipelines (T2V, I2V, A2V,
keyframe, ic-lora, hdr-ic-lora). Detailed per-commit history in `git log v0.9.0..v0.9.8`.

## [0.x] - earlier (foundations)

Initial MLX port of LTX-2.3 from Lightricks/LTX-2 reference. Bring-up of
video VAE, audio VAE + vocoder + BWE, DiT transformer, Gemma 3 12B text
encoder, conditioning system, two-stage pipelines, distilled mode.
